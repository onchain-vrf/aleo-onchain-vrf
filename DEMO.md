# Running the demo for this project

To run the demo, you are required to be running on the bash shell for it to work properly.

If you are running on a Mac or Linux machine, you would most likely already have that built in so this should work as expected.

To start the demo, run:

```bash
bash ./demo.sh
```

This should run the demo step by step, and you can continue each step by pressing any key.
